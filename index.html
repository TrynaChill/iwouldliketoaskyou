            <p>It will show 2 buttons, one saying yes and the other one saying no. Whenever the no one is pressed or hovered, it will change it's position randomly :D. <br>The links for each game, has random characters so the victim can't imagine what you're gonna ask :)<br>This website was based in the already existing one, <a href="https://you.collegeek.com/">you.collegeek.com</a>, so credits for him for most part of the code :)<br>I'll be basically creating diferent pages for different games or activities. If you think I should add anyone, write me through:</p>
